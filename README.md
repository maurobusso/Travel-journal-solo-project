# Travel Journal

This project was inspired by the Scrimba react course as a final solo project at the end of the second module of the course. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a static page that display different location with immages and a brief description and a link to the google map location.

Lessons Learned: 

Thanks to this project I was able to improve and put into practice: array manipulation, Boolean, conditionals, objects. The easy way to create randomization with the Math. method. I was also able to integrate a responsive design with CSS.
